# Project-Documentation-Collection
A collection of templates for various forms of Project Documentation, in multiple formats. Some I wrote up myself, others are random, assorted templates sourced from across the web, mostly GitHub. All Docs templates in this repository come in both Markdown and Plaintext varieties, in addition to some more 'formal', and in depth Docs Templates written in Microsoft Word, and thusly coming in *.doc/*.docx formats, as well as *.rtf. Includes README Templates, CHANGELOG Templates, CONTRIBUTING Templates, Code of Conduct Templates, various niche Documentation Types, and a collection of the most commonly used Licenses in Plaintext, Rich Formatted Text, and Markdown formats also.
